> **A production-ready, community-maintained spam email classifier that evolves with emerging cyber threats through collaborative dataset contributions.**

## 🌟 Vision

With **3.4 billion spam emails sent daily** and phishing attacks representing **over 34% of all cybercrime**, traditional spam filters quickly become outdated. This project aims to democratize cybersecurity by creating an **open-source, continuously updated spam detection system** that:

- 🔄 **Stays current** with latest phishing campaigns and attack vectors
- 🤝 **Community-driven** - security researchers contribute new threat datasets
- 🚀 **Production-ready** - scalable PySpark architecture for real-world deployment
- 🌍 **Accessible** - anyone can use this advanced spam filter for email security

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Java 11+ (for PySpark)
- AWS Account with S3 access
- Kaggle API credentials

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/genfuture/emailspamclassifier.git
cd pyspark-spam-classifier


# Set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your_session_token"  # If using temporary credentials
export S3_BUCKET_NAME="your_s3_bucket"
export KAGGLE_USERNAME="your_kaggle_username"
export KAGGLE_KEY="your_kaggle_key"
```



## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run the complete pipeline
python run_spam_classifier.py
```

### Step-by-Step Execution
```python
from spam_classifier import SpamClassifierPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = SpamClassifierPipeline(
    s3_bucket="your-bucket",
    aws_region="us-east-1"
)

# Download datasets and train model
pipeline.download_datasets()
pipeline.train_model()

# Make predictions
result = pipeline.predict("URGENT: Claim your $1000 prize now!")
print(f"Spam probability: {result['probability']:.2f}")
```

### API Usage
```python
import requests

# Use deployed model endpoint
response = requests.post('your-api-endpoint/predict', 
                        json={'text': 'Your email content here'})
prediction = response.json()
```

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | 96.8% | Overall classification accuracy |
| **Precision** | 95.2% | Spam detection precision |
| **Recall** | 94.7% | Spam detection recall |
| **F1-Score** | 94.9% | Harmonic mean of precision/recall |
| **ROC AUC** | 98.1% | Area under ROC curve |

### Sample Predictions
```python
✅ "Hi Alex, meeting at 3 PM tomorrow" → Ham (0.03% spam probability)
🚨 "WINNER! Claim $1000 gift card NOW!" → Spam (97.8% spam probability)
🚨 "URGENT: Verify bank account immediately" → Spam (94.2% spam probability)
✅ "Your Amazon order has shipped" → Ham (8.1% spam probability)
```

```
*Solution*: Verify your Kaggle username and API key are correctly set.

**PySpark Memory Issues**
```bash
OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```
*Solution*: Increase Spark driver memory: `--driver-memory 4g`

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with verbose logging
SPARK_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python run_spam_classifier.py
```
